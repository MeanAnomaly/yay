hello this is c-er speaking i made this on MeanAnomaly's nice computer
this programs is highly dank
basically it continuously runs sl (this is a dependency) with randomly generated flags (except for -e, so it can't be interrupted with ctrl+c)
it ruins the computing experience of any user of any computer it is run on
